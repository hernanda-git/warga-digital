/**
 * AuthInterceptor
 *
 * Listens for the `auth:unauthorized` CustomEvent dispatched by `apiFetch`
 * (src/lib/api-client.ts) whenever any API call returns HTTP 401.
 *
 * On receiving the event it:
 *  1. Clears the local auth state (Zustand + header-profile cookie).
 *  2. Redirects to /auth/login with a `redirect` param so the user lands back
 *     on the page they were trying to access after re-authenticating.
 *
 * WHY NOT window.fetch MONKEY-PATCHING?
 * ──────────────────────────────────────
 * The previous implementation overwrote `window.fetch` globally. That approach
 * is fragile:
 *  • Double-mount in React 18 Strict Mode patches fetch twice and the
 *    cleanup only removes the outermost wrapper, leaving a dangling intercept.
 *  • It conflicts with Suspense and concurrent rendering because React may
 *    invoke renders before the effect runs.
 *  • It makes the fetch call-stack opaque and harder to debug in DevTools.
 *
 * The CustomEvent pattern is:
 *  • Zero global mutation — the native `fetch` is never touched.
 *  • Easy to reason about: apiFetch dispatches → AuthInterceptor handles.
 *  • Safe to mount/unmount multiple times (addEventListener is idempotent
 *    when the same handler reference is used, and cleanup is reliable).
 *
 * IGNORED URLS
 * ────────────
 * Login and auth-check endpoints deliberately return 401 as part of their
 * normal flow (e.g. "PIN salah", "belum login"). Reacting to those 401s
 * would redirect the user away from the login page mid-submission.
 * We suppress the redirect for any URL that includes these prefixes.
